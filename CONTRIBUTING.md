# Contributing to the style guide

:+1: Thank you for contributing! :+1:

We take Pull Requests on this repo, and anyone is free to submit one, take the
following into account:

- Keep PRs small so their discussion will be as focused as possible.
- Check the list of non open PR for recent PRs that discuss the same topic so
  discussion does not repeat itself. Revisiting a topic after time has passed
  and new insights are available is fine.
- Include rationale for changes if the contents of the change do not make it
  obvious. Lengthy considerations should be part of the PR description, not the
  styleguide.
- The length an approved PR remains open depends on how 'controversial' the
  change is so everyone can get their opinion in.

Follow the [GNU Kind Communication Guidelines](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html)
when discussing changes.
